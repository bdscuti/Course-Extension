# Course-Extension
 
Oftentimes, people simply list course codes (like ECE 391) assuming the reader already knows what they are talking about. 
A frustrating experience when browsing is that it requires jumping across multiple sites to find the correct course catalog listing and course description.

To use
1) Download the zip file and unzip.
2) Navigate to chrome://extensions.
3) Turn on developer mode on the upper right corner.
4) Click "load unpacked" and select the folder.
5) Check if the extension is active by developer tools and verifying if you see "Course extension loaded!" in the console.

This project aims to ameriolarate that. 
First you select your university of interest by clicking on the extension icon. 
Then, you highlight some text and a tooltip will pop up showing past semester offerings of the class with its title and webpage.
This currently only supports UIUC classes but I hope to expand it to more universities using course catalog APIs and allow contributors to modify the database.
Futhermore, I hope to add a second mode that scans and add course tooltips to all the matched courses on a page.
