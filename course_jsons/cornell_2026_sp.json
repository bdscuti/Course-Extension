        "description": "This interdisciplinary course (with an emphasis in anthropology) will introduce students to the multiple routes/roots, lived experiences, and imagined worlds of South Asians who have traveled to various lands at different historical moments spanning Fiji, South Africa, Mauritius, Britain, Malaysia, United States, Trinidad, and even within South Asia itself such as the Tamil-speaking population of Sri Lanka. The course will begin with the labor migrations of the 1830s and continue up to the present period. The primary exercise will be to compare and contrast the varied expressions of the South Asian Diaspora globally in order to critically evaluate this transnational identity. Thus, we will ask what, if any, are the ties that bind a fifth-generation Indo-Trinidadian whose ancestor came to the New World as an indentured laborer or coolie in the mid-19th century to labor in the cane fields, to a Pakistani medical doctor who migrated to the United States in the late 1980s. If Diaspora violates a sense of identity based on territorial integrity, then could culture serve as the basis for a shared identity?",

This course also asks how individuals and groups in the imperial cores and peripheries use ideas of nature to critique and resist U.S. imperialism.

We then study empirical patterns of asset prices and discuss the implications of these patterns for investors' trading strategies; here, we introduce the important concept of market efficiency. Next, we discuss bond market investing and the yield curve, as well as derivative contracts such as futures and options. Finally, we discuss selected topics in behavioral finance, an active subfield within finance that tries to improve our understanding of financial markets and investor behavior using frameworks that are psychologically realistic; here, topics include a set of systematic mistakes real-world investors make, the underlying mechanisms that cause these mistakes, and ways to improve financial decision making.",

We explore topics related to diversification and purpose investing, including a highly innovative idea of a mega-fund developing cancer treatment. We examine how financial instruments can help solve or hedge some societal issues, particularly on climate change. As an example, we will be studying a financial solution to deal with California forest fire. We also examine the potential for social impact bonds for educating pre-school children and reducing prisoners' recidivism.",

Under our very noses, however, Native American history has evolved into one of the most exciting, dynamic, and contentious fields of inquiry into America's past. It is now safer to assume, as Comanche historian Paul Chaat Smith has pointed out, that everything you know about Indians is in fact wrong. Most people have much to unlearn about Native American history before true learning can take place. This course aims to achieve that end by (re)introducing students to key themes and trends in the history of North America's indigenous nations. Employing an issues-oriented approach, the course stresses the ongoing complexity of Native American societies' engagements with varieties of settler colonialism since 1492 and dedicates itself to a concerted program of myth-busting. As such, the course will provide numerous opportunities for students to develop their critical thinking and reading skills.",

Africana studies emphasizes comparative and interdisciplinary studies of Africa, the U.S., the Caribbean and other diasporas. In this course, we will look at the diverse contours of the discipline. We will explore contexts ranging from modernity and the Trans-Atlantic slave trade and plantation complex in the New World to processes of decolonization and globalization in the contemporary digital age. This course offers an introduction to the study of Africa, the U.S., the Caribbean and other diasporas. This course will examine, through a range of disciplines, among them literature, history, politics, philosophy, the themes - including race/racism, the Middle Passage, sexuality, colonialism, and culture - that have dominated Africana Studies since its inception in the late-1960s. We will explore these issues in an attempt to understand how black lives have been shaped in a historical sense; and, of course, the effects of these issues in the contemporary moment. This course seeks to introduce these themes, investigate through one or more of the disciplines relevant to the question, and provide a broad understanding of the themes so as to enable the kind of intellectual reflection critical to Africana Studies.",

Racial inequality and structural racism are chief among such problems. Policy is thus widely understood and frequently touted as a means for redressing the harms of racism. Yet, public policy has also been identified as a channel through which racism flows. These seemingly paradoxical understandings of the relationships between racism and public policy raise critical questions about equality, democracy, the economy, and politics. This course examines such questions. questions. We begin by theoretically grounding key concepts such as race racism and public policy. We then consider the historical record, highlighting the fundamental role of racism in shaping politics and policy. Next, we build on these conceptual and historical foundations through thematic investigation of core policy elements (e.g., policy design, policy implementation, policy feedback), key policy institutions (e.g., legislatures, parties) and significant policy actors (e.g., social movement organizations, interest groups). Finally, the class wraps up with a series of policy deep dives involving close examination of specific policy domains (e.g., housing, health, the enviornment).

Most people have much to unlearn about Native American history before true learning can take place. This course aims to achieve that end by (re)introducing students to key themes and trends in the history of North America's indigenous nations. Employing an issues-oriented approach, the course stresses the ongoing complexity of Native American societies' engagements with varieties of settler colonialism since 1492 and dedicates itself to a concerted program of myth-busting.

Improved access to higher education has brought millions of Americans into the middle class, and yet rising selectivity has meant that a disproportionate share of the economic elite come from a few top colleges. This course will explore the three big parts of the college experience --- (1) admissions and the college-going decision; (2) education while in college; and (3) college completion and labor market entry --- and ask how each part contributes to inequality in economic outcomes. Lectures and readings will focus on simple economic theories of higher education as well as the empirical methods used to test these theories.",

Beginning with early Cold War hostility (1949–1972), the Korean War (1950–1953), and the prolonged diplomatic estrangement (1953–1972), the course traces pivotal moments such as Nixon’s historic rapprochement (1972-1979), the cautious engagement of normalization (1979–1989), China’s economic rise and global integration (1990s–2008), and the evolving tensions of interdependence often described as ‘One Bed, Two Dreams’ (2008–present), shifting security dilemmas, and ongoing trade and technological competition. Special attention will be given to the contemporary landscape of strategic containment, rivalry, and the price of competition and cooperation. Through a multidisciplinary approach, students will analyze primary sources, academic literature, government reports, and firsthand accounts to assess how U.S.-China relations have evolved within a broader global context.

The course will begin with the labor migrations of the 1830s and continue up to the present period. The primary exercise will be to compare and contrast the varied expressions of the South Asian Diaspora globally in order to critically evaluate this transnational identity. Thus, we will ask what, if any, are the ties that bind a fifth-generation Indo-Trinidadian whose ancestor came to the New World as an indentured laborer or coolie in the mid-19th century to labor in the cane fields, to a Pakistani medical doctor who migrated to the United States in the late 1980s.

In the process, students will gain a working knowledge of ecological, critical, phenomenological, and applied approaches used by medical anthropologists. We will investigate what is involved in becoming a doctor, the sociality of medicines, controversies over new medical technologies, and the politics of medical knowledge. The universality of biomedicine, or hospital medicine, will not be taken for granted, but rather we will examine the plurality generated by the various political, economic, social, and ethical demands under which biomedicine has developed in different places and at different times. In addition, biomedical healing and expertise will be viewed in relation to other kinds of healing and expertise. Our readings will address medicine in North America as well as other parts of the world.

We begin by examining the classic theories of religion in the works of Durkheim, Marx, Weber, Mauss, and Freud, among others, followed by an exploration of how these theories have been influential in anthropological studies of symbolism, cosmology, ritual, selfhood, myth, sorcery, witchcraft, and pilgrimage. We conclude by examining the apparent persistence, revival and transformation of religious and magical beliefs and practices within modern, modernizing, and postcolonial states. We ask whether an increasing politicization and globalization of religious ideology through technological mediation poses significant challenges to the anthropological analysis of religion. In so doing, we also try to understand better the human experience of and identification with the spiritual, mythical, and religious in the contemporary moment. This, in turn, leads us to investigate the inherent volatility of such identifications and experiences within the larger national and global framework of cultural politics.",

Over the course of the semester, students complete a documentary film based on an immersive engagement with their selected subject matter. Alongside watching and discussing relevant texts and films, students will complete exercises to help them focus their projects, build a cohesive narrative, learn script writing, brainstorm scene ideas, overcome narrative challenges, discover their aesthetic, and develop a film circulation plan. Students will regularly present new footage and scenes and explain their work in terms their goals for the final project. The course culminates in a public screening of students' independent video projects.",

Keeping in mind broader issues of cross-cultural representation, we consider the evolution of ethnographic film as a genre for representing reality, embodied practices, and anthropological concepts. Students will examine ethnographic authority, the production of otherness, and the sensory dimensions of knowledge production. The course charts out various approaches to ethnographic film, ranging from the mobilization of the camera as a tool for storytelling, scientific record and analysis, empowerment and political advocacy, and arts and aesthetics. We will theorize the role and status of ethnographic film as a signifying practice, form of meaning-making, and mode of anthropological theory building. We will pay close attention to the ethical and political concerns of cross-cultural communication and representation.",

We begin by examining classic and contemporary phenomenological, psychodynamic, semiotic, structuralist, and post-structuralist theories of self and subject formation. Moving into the ethnographic literature, we assess the utility of these models for understanding the selves of others, particularly in critical juxtaposition to multiple and alternate theories of the self and person as understood in different cultures. By examining debates in the anthropology of emotion, cognition, healing, and mental health we bring into sharper focus the particular theoretical and empirical contributions, as well as the failures, of anthropologists towards developing a cross-cultural psychology.",

We will take a thematic approach, progressing chronologically and introducing key genres where appropriate. First, we will explore central issues of symbolism, landscape, and materials through the architecture and furnishings of temples and royal tombs. Next come the social worlds of art. Can we speak of artists? How were gender, class, and ethnicity represented? Finally, we will survey the legacies of Egyptian visual culture in antiquity and the modern West.",

        "description": "The art of Ancient Greece and Rome has a complex legacy within western culture that is inseparable from ideas about power, beauty, identity, and knowledge. As such, 'Classical' art has been appropriated for all kinds of ends, many of them deeply problematic. But what did ancient statues, paintings, vessels, or buildings mean for the cultures that originally created, viewed, and lived alongside them? How were they embedded within political and social structures, religious practices, and public or domestic spaces? What can they tell us about practices of representation and story-telling? How might they help us access ancient attitudes to gender, ethnicity, or social status? And why is any of this still relevant today? This course on Greek and Roman art and archaeology will address all these questions. Covering the time span from the Bronze Age (3rd millennium BCE) to the late Roman Empire (4th century CE), we will focus on one object or monument each lecture, considering how it can be considered exemplary for its time. Where possible, we will engage with artefacts in our collections at Cornell, including the plaster-casts, as we develop skills in viewing, analyzing, and contextualizing material evidence.",

Besides those, the seminar focuses on the development of the site from an early hero cult to panhellenic sanctuary, its embeddedness in the landscape, its various political affiliations and mediterranean networks, its artistic productions, but also on Olympia as tourist destination in antiquity and today. Moreover, the site has been a laboratory of archaeological methods and negotiations of cultural heritage which we will revisit, beginning with the French and German excavations in the 19th century and continuing to this day with the involvement of a larger international community. Nazi Germany (Berlin 1936), Western Germany (Munich 1972), Greece (Athens 2004), and Cornell (Temple of Zeus Café) will serve as case studies on the modern reception of Olympia.",

Charismatic leaders, fascism, colonialism, sexism, racism, capitalism, globalism, climate change, famine, migration, militarism, and collapse—all have correlates or origins in the Bronze Age that we study through a variety of textual sources, including the Amarna Letters, Ramesside papyri and cuneiform documents from Syria and Turkey.

Archaeological and textual evidence suggest that two major socioeconomic processes played a part: the creation of the first known international system, and climate change. In our class we explore how ancient leaders reacted (or not) to these processes and what their reactions teach us about more current events. Charismatic leaders, fascism, colonialism, sexism, racism, capitalism, globalism, climate change, famine, migration, militarism, and collapse—all have correlates or origins in the Bronze Age that we study through a variety of textual sources, including the Amarna Letters, Ramesside papyri and cuneiform documents from Syria and Turkey. We also become familiar with several archaeological sites, including the Uluburun shipwreck and Ugarit, offering unique windows onto the transformative times at the end of the Bronze Age.",

It examines all aspects of culture that communicate through visual means, including 20th-century visual technologies-photography, cinema, video, etc., and their historical corollaries. The production and consumption of images, objects, and events is studied in diverse cultures. Students develop the critical skills necessary to appreciate how the approaches that define visual studies complicate traditional models of defining and analyzing art objects.",

        "description": "The art of Ancient Greece and Rome has a complex legacy within western culture that is inseparable from ideas about power, beauty, identity, and knowledge. As such, 'Classical' art has been appropriated for all kinds of ends, many of them deeply problematic. But what did ancient statues, paintings, vessels, or buildings mean for the cultures that originally created, viewed, and lived alongside them? How were they embedded within political and social structures, religious practices, and public or domestic spaces? What can they tell us about practices of representation and story-telling? How might they help us access ancient attitudes to gender, ethnicity, or social status? And why is any of this still relevant today? This course on Greek and Roman art and archaeology will address all these questions. Covering the time span from the Bronze Age (3rd millennium BCE) to the late Roman Empire (4th century CE), we will focus on one object or monument each lecture, considering how it can be considered exemplary for its time. Where possible, we will engage with artefacts in our collections at Cornell, including the plaster-casts, as we develop skills in viewing, analyzing, and contextualizing material evidence.",

We will take a thematic approach, progressing chronologically and introducing key genres where appropriate. First, we will explore central issues of symbolism, landscape, and materials through the architecture and furnishings of temples and royal tombs. Next come the social worlds of art. Can we speak of artists? How were gender, class, and ethnicity represented? Finally, we will survey the legacies of Egyptian visual culture in antiquity and the modern West.",

Besides those, the seminar focuses on the development of the site from an early hero cult to panhellenic sanctuary, its embeddedness in the landscape, its various political affiliations and mediterranean networks, its artistic productions, but also on Olympia as tourist destination in antiquity and today. Moreover, the site has been a laboratory of archaeological methods and negotiations of cultural heritage which we will revisit, beginning with the French and German excavations in the 19th century and continuing to this day with the involvement of a larger international community. Nazi Germany (Berlin 1936), Western Germany (Munich 1972), Greece (Athens 2004), and Cornell (Temple of Zeus Café) will serve as case studies on the modern reception of Olympia.",

We will track the permutations of black conceptualism through conceptual art and visual abstraction, investigating the pressure blackness places on the assumptive logics of conceptual art as well as the potential the genre holds for understanding black being differently. Artists and thinkers will include: Adrian Piper, Lorna Simpson, W.E.B. DuBois, Huey Copeland, Hortense Spillers, David Marriott, Senga Nengudi, Steve McQueen, Cameron Rowland, Robert Morris, Clement Greenberg.",

The influence of cinema on twentieth-century aesthetics cannot be overstated, yet art historians routinely work without enough knowledge about the history of cinema or the grammar and rhetoric of its techniques.  The history of montage, continuity editing, cinematography, and narrative form will be covered as we encounter major works from world cinema in dialogue with significant movements in modern art.  German Expressionism, Surrealism, Italian Neorealism, Documentary Film, Film Noir, Hollywood Auteurism, East Asian Auteurism, and Bollywood Cinema will be among the major movements covered, as will the late entry into the fine art world of moving image media.",

With mythologized origins among communities of obscure holy men living in the mountains of South Asia, yoga-centered traditions are now part of a multi-billion-dollar global industry, endorsed by celebrities and everyday people alike. In fact, statistics show that at least 1 out of 6 Americans today performs some kind of regular yoga routine. Indeed, the image of the proverbial yoga practitioner has been so influential on American public life, that at least two popular cultural icons from the past century, a baseball player and a cartoon character, have borne the first name Yogi. This course examines the evolution of yogic systems across three key historical periods—the classical, colonial, and contemporary—and offers students new perspectives on how activities that originated or stemmed from religious practice have acquired new meanings and objectives. Our approach will allow us to investigate both the continuities and disruptions within yogic philosophies from ancient times to the present. It will also allow us to assess how yoga-related concepts intersect in present times with notions of spiritual liberation, health and wellness, capitalist success, and racial justice.",

        "description": "Ever since the creation of the concept of a culturally and geographically stable center in China, people have been intentionally excluded from that center. Disgraced officials are sent to far-flung provinces, loyalists to past regimes hide out across China’s borders, and dissidents have their entry visas revoked, making it impossible for them to return home. The experiences of these people, and the poems and stories they write, tell us a great deal about what it means and how it feels to be included and excluded. What is the difference between the way China looks from the inside and the way it looks from the outside? Who has the power to decide who gets to live in China, and how and why do they use it? What is the relationship between our identities and our homes? Texts studied will range from 300 BCE to the present; all will be read and discussed in English. (LL)",

China is aiming to dominate future product cycles, and is making major inroads in digital technology, AI, and robotics.

This course proceeds by assessing the interplay between marketization and economic transformation on the one hand, and social change and resistance as seen from the perspective of workers, on the other.

Its mineral resources travel the globe - the uranium used to bomb Japan in 1945 came from the Congo, and if you have a cellphone, you probably have a bit of the Congo in your pocket. But the region has been a key site for global trade for centuries. More than 400 years ago, diplomats from the mighty Kongo kingdom were stationed in Brazil and Europe, intervening in global affairs. Later, more than seven million enslaved people were forcibly taken from the region, a trade that brought terrible suffering, but also ensured that Congo region culture and politics would shape the Atlantic world. The Congo's first democratically elected leader, Patrice Lumumba, inspired generations of freedom fighters around the world, and his assassination at the hands of Belgian forces and their Congolese allies (with aid from Canadian soldiers and the CIA) has inspired outrage ever since - and transformed African geopolitics. The Congo was arguably the site of the first struggle for a second decolonization on the African continent, and activists have been fighting to democratize the state since the 1960s. It is famed for its novelists, philosophers, musicians, and artists. This course will explore the Congo region's global influence, and consider how diverse globalizations shaped the region.",

Looking at the works of Mannoni, Fanon, Nawal El Saadawi, Micere Mugo, Chinua Achebe, Joseph Conrad, and others, we shall try to paint a picture that engages the voices and vulnerabilities of both lion and hunter.",

Senator Wade of Ohio, among three Whig politicians impatient with Abraham Lincoln's acccommodationism in relation to the defeated South, proposes a certain radical policy. That is, the newly liberated slaves must be willing to act their former oppressors. Du Bois, in cursory parliamentary fashion, makes mention of Wade's radicalism but never engages it. However, in his biography of John Brown, we find Du Bois' thinking of a piece with Wade's. This course will chart the unfolding of Du Bois's critique: from his non-engagement to what we might take to be an almost full embrace of Wade's proposal through the radical actions of John Brown.",

This course, taking its cue from Levinas' \"Difficult Freedom,\" demonstrates the circumscription of that Levinasian concept. The particular universal, this course will show, is limited by Levinas, in the moment of philosophical truth, to those whom he assigns the designation \"particular universal.\" This course will account for why it is Levinas' other is a figure circumscribed by identitarian proclivities. As such, it will ask why it is Levinas excludes those whom he excludes, and, most importantly, how what raises a particular set of difficulties in relation to Levinas as renowned thinker of the ethical.",

The course introduces students to a laboratory research environment, teamwork, hypothesis formation, experimental design, statistics, and research ethics. Students gain information and science literacy skills and practice many forms of science communication, from presentations to proposal writing and scientific poster preparation. Students first fill their scientific toolbox and then develop the capacity to solve increasingly challenging problems more independently.",

The goal of this course is for students to learn about microbiology and microbial ecology as it relates to them - in the college campus environment. Students will learn about viruses, bacteria, eukarotes and metazoans that cause common illnesses (i.e. gastroenteritis, influenza and STDs), the microbially-driven elemental cycling of alcohol production, and ecology of microorganism that spoil food. Students will take away a practical understanding of the microorganisms that they can apply to their own lives. This course is suitable for non-life sciences majors.",

        "description": "Food intake is a complex behavior that is strictly regulated by sensory, homeostatic, and hedonic neural circuits, which balance energy intake with energy expenditure. An integrated system of external sensory information works together with peripheral body organs and the central nervous system to produce the sensation of food and the drive to consume. The balanced functioning of this interconnected physiological system is critical for humans and other organisms to control the nutrient intake and maintain stable body weight. In eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa, or in metabolic syndromes, such as obesity, the perception of food and the homeostatic balance between hunger and satiety is dysregulated leading to weight loss or gain and associated health problems. In this course, students will learn about the current and past research on neural control of food intake and energy metabolism. I will introduce the topic and cover the main discoveries in a discussion-based lecture. After the lecture, each week, students will collaboratively present a topic. The first student will present an overview of the research topic. The second student will present the research article for the week. Each student will present twice (once in each slot).

As cancer immunotherapies are emerging, understanding of cancer and immunity in deeper manners as a separate topic is required, but also, the abilities to combine both topics in physiologically relevant contexts and relevant knowledge in bioengineering approaches (biomaterials, drug delivery systems, tissue engineering) are needed to be able to solve the multifactorial disease. In this course, we will discuss the topics in Cancer Engineering (module 1); Immune Engineering (module 2); and Cancer Immunotherapy (module 3). In each module, critical biological concepts will be discussed, followed by engineering perspectives, and updated case studies from experts in the cancer and immune-engineering field.",

In the process, students will gain a working knowledge of ecological, critical, phenomenological, and applied approaches used by medical anthropologists. We will investigate what is involved in becoming a doctor, the sociality of medicines, controversies over new medical technologies, and the politics of medical knowledge. The universality of biomedicine, or hospital medicine, will not be taken for granted, but rather we will examine the plurality generated by the various political, economic, social, and ethical demands under which biomedicine has developed in different places and at different times. In addition, biomedical healing and expertise will be viewed in relation to other kinds of healing and expertise. Our readings will address medicine in North America as well as other parts of the world.

Beginning with early Cold War hostility (1949–1972), the Korean War (1950–1953), and the prolonged diplomatic estrangement (1953–1972), the course traces pivotal moments such as Nixon’s historic rapprochement (1972-1979), the cautious engagement of normalization (1979–1989), China’s economic rise and global integration (1990s–2008), and the evolving tensions of interdependence often described as ‘One Bed, Two Dreams’ (2008–present), shifting security dilemmas, and ongoing trade and technological competition. Special attention will be given to the contemporary landscape of strategic containment, rivalry, and the price of competition and cooperation. Through a multidisciplinary approach, students will analyze primary sources, academic literature, government reports, and firsthand accounts to assess how U.S.-China relations have evolved within a broader global context.

In particular, students will learn to combine data and models to control overall system performance in the face of uncertainty.  The class will focus on smart city infrastructure systems that are self-aware, with continual surveillance of the built and natural environment and an autonomous capacity to control resource allocation.  This course will build upon fundamental engineering principles (for systems such as transportation, energy, and water resources) and teach students to employ emerging sensor technologies, accompanying data analytics, resource demand forecasting, and model predictive control theory.  Students will learn to couple engineering models of infrastructure with data-driven probabilistic models of resource demand and the approaches to control these integrated hybrid systems for optimal and equitable resource allocation with improved resilience to exogenous disturbances. Finally, the class will explore cases studies in urban flooding, energy supply, transportation and air quality, and water supply.",

As such, 'Classical' art has been appropriated for all kinds of ends, many of them deeply problematic. But what did ancient statues, paintings, vessels, or buildings mean for the cultures that originally created, viewed, and lived alongside them? How were they embedded within political and social structures, religious practices, and public or domestic spaces? What can they tell us about practices of representation and story-telling? How might they help us access ancient attitudes to gender, ethnicity, or social status? And why is any of this still relevant today? This course on Greek and Roman art and archaeology will address all these questions. Covering the time span from the Bronze Age (3rd millennium BCE) to the late Roman Empire (4th century CE), we will focus on one object or monument each lecture, considering how it can be considered exemplary for its time.

Besides those, the seminar focuses on the development of the site from an early hero cult to panhellenic sanctuary, its embeddedness in the landscape, its various political affiliations and mediterranean networks, its artistic productions, but also on Olympia as tourist destination in antiquity and today. Moreover, the site has been a laboratory of archaeological methods and negotiations of cultural heritage which we will revisit, beginning with the French and German excavations in the 19th century and continuing to this day with the involvement of a larger international community. Nazi Germany (Berlin 1936), Western Germany (Munich 1972), Greece (Athens 2004), and Cornell (Temple of Zeus Café) will serve as case studies on the modern reception of Olympia.",

What does it mean to say that music is an embodied behavioral act? What is the relationship between music and memory?

By reading and analyzing their scholarship-critiquing them and engaging their ideas-we will craft our own methods and voices. Students will refine their research methods (library research, note taking, organizing material, bibliographies, citation methods, proposals, outlines, etc.) and design their own independent research project.",

        "description": "Psychoanalysis considers the human being not as an object of treatment, but as a subject who is called upon to elaborate an unconscious knowledge about what is disrupting her life, through analysis of dreams, symptoms, bungled actions, slips of the tongue, and repetitive behaviors.  Freud finds that these apparently irrational acts and behavior are ordered by the logic of the fantasy, which provides a mental representation of a traumatic childhood experience and the effects it unleashes in the mind and body-effects he called drives.  As unbound energies, the drives give rise to symptoms, repetitive acts, and fantasmatic stagings that menace our health and sometimes threaten social coexistence, but that also rise to the desires, creative acts, and social projects we identify as the essence of human life.  Readings will include fundamental texts on the unconscious, repression, fantasy, and the death drive, as well as case studies and speculative essays on mythology, art, religion, and group psychology.  Students will be asked to keep a dream journal and to work on their unconscious formations, and will have the chance to produce creative projects as well as analytic essays.",

The experiences of these people, and the poems and stories they write, tell us a great deal about what it means and how it feels to be included and excluded. What is the difference between the way China looks from the inside and the way it looks from the outside? Who has the power to decide who gets to live in China, and how and why do they use it? What is the relationship between our identities and our homes? Texts studied will range from 300 BCE to the present; all will be read and discussed in English. (LL)",

Yet critical theory’s insights into processes of subject formation, social relations, mass culture, and general emancipatory drive continue to inform and be of value to scholars of race concerned with the everyday production and transmission of ideas about normative humanity. At the same time, in their engagement with theory's blindspots, scholars of race demonstrate the racialized histories, contexts, and assumptions that make up that for which \"theory\" cannot account, as well as that from which it has unquestioningly emerged. This course explores contemporary critical scholarship on race, as defined by its relationship to anti-positivist epistemologies, theories of the subject, critiques of traditional ontology and aesthetics, and engagement with the Black radical tradition, environmental humanities, psychoanalysis, and more.

Extending the concept of biopolitics—the governance of populations through the imbrication of life processes into political calculations to enhance the former—the course foregrounds how computational systems, algorithms, and data practices shape and are shaped by cultural, political, and economic forces. The interdisciplinary course, linking political philosophy, media theory, and race studies, thinks with a wide range of scholars for whom digitality, as it encounters biopolitics, is generative for a deeper understanding of the datafied world. This exploration follows sections, including data as a resource, digital embodiment and corporeality, digital labor and necropolitics, and biopolitical resistance in digital spaces. Foundational to the course are inquiries about posthumanism and ethics, such as: How does the digital reconfigure traditional boundaries between human and non-human, self and other?

        "description": "“Prophetic Realisms” explores the notion that certain literary texts – those that are deeply embedded in the socio-economic totality of the world they build – not only provide insight into the present world, but also anticipate the shape of things to come: the tendencies and trajectories of coming historical formations. The latent is already manifest so that, strangely, one of the proving grounds of literature is history. This idea is very pronounced in Georg Lukacs’ 1930s writing on Realism, but also shared by his antagonists in the ‘Expressionist Debates,’ such as Ernst Bloch: the one point they agree on is literature’s ability to ‘anticipate’ historical developments. This idea is expressed, in a different way, by Erich Auerbach’s 1937 essay “On the Serious Imitation of the Everyday” and 1938 essay “figura”. In this course we will look at these 1930s writings, constellating them with the 1830s texts that harken back to as anticipating the direction of capitalism (Balzac, but also Stendahl), alongside the early 1900s novels anticipating the rise of fascism (Heinrich Mann, but also Fallada), and finally juxtaposing them with science fiction since the 1960s, including theoretical reflections on them with respect to ‘prediction’, such as Philip K Dick, Octavia Butler, and Margaret Atwood. We are interested in moments when historical time seems to become ‘concentrated,’ hence the axes of 1830/1930/2030.",

        "description": "This course is a theoretical exploration of digital biopolitics, a convergence of how digital technologies mediate, govern, and regulate life, particularly within frameworks of power and control. Extending the concept of biopolitics—the governance of populations through the imbrication of life processes into political calculations to enhance the former—the course foregrounds how computational systems, algorithms, and data practices shape and are shaped by cultural, political, and economic forces. The interdisciplinary course, linking political philosophy, media theory, and race studies, thinks with a wide range of scholars for whom digitality, as it encounters biopolitics, is generative for a deeper understanding of the datafied world. This exploration follows sections, including data as a resource, digital embodiment and corporeality, digital labor and necropolitics, and biopolitical resistance in digital spaces. Foundational to the course are inquiries about posthumanism and ethics, such as: How does the digital reconfigure traditional boundaries between human and non-human, self and other? As technology mediates biopolitical power, who holds systems accountable for harm and injustice?",

In our increasingly consumerist and digitized culture we still assign value beyond the immediate function of objects, an act that plays a crucial role in constituting memory, identity, and in our understanding of the past, present, and future. In this course students will write about the ways objects communicate meaning, conduct research into the cultural, political, and economic contexts surrounding material artifacts, and across several essays and a group project explore the ways objects both small and large can impact the way we think about ourselves and our world.",

Thus, this course will introduce us to different frameworks, research, and practices that can help us understand the important role of communication in different, U.S., migration experiences. On the one hand, communication can help mitigate some of the social and structural barriers that migrants face in the United States and elsewhere. On the other hand, communication can also exacerbate or lead to educational, economic, and health inequities among migrants. We will consider both ways in which communication can function for migrant communities. Overall, migration: (1) is a diverse area of research that can incorporate intrapersonal, interpersonal, community, organizational, institutional, cultural, and policy levels of analysis; (2) is studied using a wide range of methodologies; and (3) is affected by a variety of communication channels. The readings and content of this course primarily focus on the experiences of Latina/o/x immigrant communities in the U.S.",

They are places where people make homes, work, and mobilize politically. They are sites where governments, private actors, and civil society shape the built and socio-economic environment. The course critically examines cities and regions across the globe and in varying time periods. It introduces students to the promise, beauty, and challenges facing cities, including poverty and inequality, access to housing and infrastructure, and climate change. The course offers students an introduction to urban studies and entry points to urban focused work in other disciplines. It combines lectures, discussion, and active learning modes.",

Then, how do we produce effective qualitative research questions? What data should we gather to address those questions? What methods should we use? How do we prepare for field research? How do we process and analyze the collected data? How do we link literature, research questions, methods, and data to formulate arguments and make conclusions? Throughout the semester, we will address these questions through lecturers, in-class activities, method exercises, and data analysis workshops. The goal of the course is to give students hands-on experiences with qualitative research that contributes to understanding urban and regional issues in our society. The course is loosely organized around the stages and techniques of designing and conducting qualitative research. Students will practice using qualitative research methods to collect data, analyze it, draw conclusions, and observe professional research ethics. Students will also learn about how qualitative methods contribute to scientific inquiry and how identity, power, and politics interplay to influence the qualitative research process and outcomes.",

Cities are not just nodes on transaction networks, or physical collections of build form specific to a context and global movements, or diverse places that represent a mix of cultures over time. They are political assemblages in which formal and informal institutions of governance are forged and continue to be shaped as policies change and morph over time. Various processes impacting societies shape the cities where we live, work, and play: ranging from climate change, shifting migration patterns, and large-scale population movements to changes in geo-political power and the technologies of infrastructure, communication, and manufacturing. But what constitutes the city? What concepts allow us to understand how cities grow, shrink, or expand, and shivel or thrive? This course seeks to introduce you to the broad contours of an interdisciplinary body of work that aims to theorize the city. Using a format of readings, lectures, and discussions, we seek to become familiar with core perspectives of well-established traditions in urban theory that emerges from perspectives on city economy, spatial development, environment, infrastructure, social life, cultural experience, urban politics, and interventions.",

The goals of the course are to understand methods of economic and demographic analysis, the assumptions they involve and how they are implemented. The course will provide opportunities for reflection on how these methods are applied and used to inform urban planning and the various policies that flow from it. In short, it engages with quantitative methods for spatial economic and demographic analysis that shape the evidence-base used in plans, policies, and related decision-making. The course is scientific in nature and, therefore, emphasizes the complementarity of positive analysis and normative thinking.",

However, cities are also sites of growing socio-economic inequalities and environmental problems. Do cities provide the opportunity to address environmental problems, or are they rather the source of pollution and environmental degradation? Are cities the appropriate scale at which to address environmental problems? Are these really urban issues or do cities just cluster resource use and problems so they are more visible? What role does the built or physical environment have in impacting our behavior and decision making? This course examines social, economic, cultural, political and environmental dimensions of sustainability and sustainable development in urban areas.",

Then, how do we produce effective qualitative research questions? What data should we gather to address those questions? What methods should we use? How do we prepare for field research? How do we process and analyze the collected data? How do we link literature, research questions, methods, and data to formulate arguments and make conclusions? Throughout the semester, we will address these questions through lecturers, in-class activities, method exercises, and data analysis workshops. The goal of the course is to give students hands-on experiences with qualitative research that contributes to understanding urban and regional issues in our society. The course is loosely organized around the stages and techniques of designing and conducting qualitative research. Students will practice using qualitative research methods to collect data, analyze it, draw conclusions, and observe professional research ethics. Students will also learn about how qualitative methods contribute to scientific inquiry and how identity, power, and politics interplay to influence the qualitative research process and outcomes.",

Over the last several decades, economists have developed theoretical frameworks and empirical tools to understand the fundamental frictions that limit growth—why credit and insurance markets fail, why technologies do not diffuse, why individuals underinvest in education or migration, and how these failures shape inequality and welfare.\nThis course investigates these questions by combining economic theory with empirical evidence from both observational and experimental studies. We begin with a simple framework for thinking about the forces that drive development and the market imperfections that can slow it down. We then apply this framework to specific domains—credit and savings, technology adoption, labor markets, and mobility—to understand how these frictions interact and how policy can address them.",

The course emphasizes the design and econometrics of such experiments, as well as their application to study research questions in organizations. The first part of the course looks at why we use field experiments, as well as the econometric assumptions we make when using them. The second part of the course looks at how field experiments are used in organizations to study topics including whether firms underprovide training, how social connections matter for performance at work, and whether different pay scales are motivating or demotivating for workers.",

Building on this research, this course explores recent advancements at the crossroads of labor and spatial economics. It begins by examining the growing disparities between cities and regions in terms of productivity, labor market opportunities, and amenities, in several countries. It then investigates the rationale behind place-based policies and their potential to stimulate local development.

But, as this survey of modern literatures in English will explore, writing is also itself a powerful and enduring technology — one through which we shape thought, retrieve it from the past, send it to the future, and travel in space. Surveying 250 years of writing in English, we will ask how writing caused and responded to radical changes in the meaning of the human, and how it represented, contested, or collaborated with the long-burning explosion of new media — from the telephone to the television, from notebooks to typewriters, radio to computers.",

We'll read some of Chaucer's brilliant early work, and then dig into his two greatest achievements: the epic Troilus and Crisyede, and The Canterbury Tales, his oft-censored panorama of medieval English life.

The plot of the Victorian novel—sexual betrayal, pathological greed, the sadistic damage wrought on helpless children— reflects wrenching social, scientific, and technological transformations whose global sweep rivals that of our own era’s conflicts. Intertwining domestic and imperial spaces, realistic fiction embodied the most innovative attempt to grasp and contain such seismic shifts in an entertaining idiom for a rising mass readership. These works refract the cultural debates of the age and suggest sources of redemption. We can take pleasure in them even as we critically analyze how the Victorians live now.

At stake are the narrative and figurative moments in theoretical texts as well as crucial literary sources (novels, novellas, and plays) as they collectively develop the modern economic paradigms of industry, exchange, credit-debt, and interest – as well as the people they often leave out: women, people of color, the working class.

Not assuming that women were the same then as now, this course, in dialogue with contemporary trans and genderqueer theory, will look at medieval gender in a new light. Considering works by women, like the Book of Margery Kempe, some primary texts about women, like the trial of Joan of Arc, and some scholarship about alternatives to the binary of women and men, like Leah DeVun's The Shape of Sex: Nonbinary Gender from Genesis to the Renaissance, this course will examine \"woman\" as a constructed category and \"The Middle Ages\" as one instance of the long work of making involved in issuing women into the common-sense category that they now occupy.",

The poem's popular appeal lies in its complex depictions of monsters, its accounts of heroic bravery, and its lavish portrayals of life in the Meadhall. Through close readings we will also explore the darker side of the poem: its punishing depictions of loss and exile, despairing meditations on unstable kingship and dynastic failure, and harrowing depictions of heroic defeat and the vanities of existence on the Middle-Earth. Attention will be given to the poem's cultural contexts, its literary heritage, and its layered pagan and Christian perspectives. A bilingual edition of the poem will be assigned so that students may read in Old and Modern English.",

Units on environmental genres (including georgic and pastoral), embodiment and medicine (especially in the Hippocratic tradition of airs, waters, and places), weather, disaster, and contagion.",

We will examine how Confucian notions of gender and family were, far from being fixed, constantly redefined by the historical and temporal needs of East Asian contexts.

Freud finds that these apparently irrational acts and behavior are ordered by the logic of the fantasy, which provides a mental representation of a traumatic childhood experience and the effects it unleashes in the mind and body-effects he called drives.  As unbound energies, the drives give rise to symptoms, repetitive acts, and fantasmatic stagings that menace our health and sometimes threaten social coexistence, but that also rise to the desires, creative acts, and social projects we identify as the essence of human life.  Readings will include fundamental texts on the unconscious, repression, fantasy, and the death drive, as well as case studies and speculative essays on mythology, art, religion, and group psychology.

Thus we will give necessary attention to the disability experience as it overlaps and connects with lived experiences of race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and citizenship, among others.

Focusing on queer communities of color, course participants will be asked to interrogate the ways in which nightlife demonstrates the queer world-making potential that exists beyond the normative 9-5 capitalist model of production. Performances of the everyday, alongside films, texts, and performance art, will be analyzed through a performance studies methodological lens. Through close readings and sustained cultural analysis, students will acquire a critical understanding of the potentiality of spaces, places, and geographies codified as after hours in the development of subcultures, alternative sexualities, and emerging performance practices.

As unbound energies, the drives give rise to symptoms, repetitive acts, and fantasmatic stagings that menace our health and sometimes threaten social coexistence, but that also rise to the desires, creative acts, and social projects we identify as the essence of human life.  Readings will include fundamental texts on the unconscious, repression, fantasy, and the death drive, as well as case studies and speculative essays on mythology, art, religion, and group psychology.

        "description": "What does being “genuine to oneself” mean? Can one really know what is authentic, or is all self-presentation a form of pretense? This course delves into the tension between phoniness and awkwardness as it appears in narrative fiction. If one rejects phoniness, one may appear awkward or out of sync with social norms. Yet embracing pretense erodes authenticity. What is the “self” to which one is genuine? Writing in this class is inseparable from critical reading. Assignments include weekly short responses and five 5-page essays. From sentimentalism to satire, readings include presentations of “phoniness”, e.g. Goethe’s “The Sorrows of Young Werther” and Nabokov’s “Pnin”. We will explore how phoniness implicates aesthetic, moral, and economic values.",

Freud finds that these apparently irrational acts and behavior are ordered by the logic of the fantasy, which provides a mental representation of a traumatic childhood experience and the effects it unleashes in the mind and body-effects he called drives.  As unbound energies, the drives give rise to symptoms, repetitive acts, and fantasmatic stagings that menace our health and sometimes threaten social coexistence, but that also rise to the desires, creative acts, and social projects we identify as the essence of human life.  Readings will include fundamental texts on the unconscious, repression, fantasy, and the death drive, as well as case studies and speculative essays on mythology, art, religion, and group psychology.  Students will be asked to keep a dream journal and to work on their unconscious formations, and will have the chance to produce creative projects as well as analytic essays.",

        "description": "“Prophetic Realisms” explores the notion that certain literary texts – those that are deeply embedded in the socio-economic totality of the world they build – not only provide insight into the present world, but also anticipate the shape of things to come: the tendencies and trajectories of coming historical formations. The latent is already manifest so that, strangely, one of the proving grounds of literature is history. This idea is very pronounced in Georg Lukacs’ 1930s writing on Realism, but also shared by his antagonists in the ‘Expressionist Debates,’ such as Ernst Bloch: the one point they agree on is literature’s ability to ‘anticipate’ historical developments. This idea is expressed, in a different way, by Erich Auerbach’s 1937 essay “On the Serious Imitation of the Everyday” and 1938 essay “figura”. In this course we will look at these 1930s writings, constellating them with the 1830s texts that harken back to as anticipating the direction of capitalism (Balzac, but also Stendahl), alongside the early 1900s novels anticipating the rise of fascism (Heinrich Mann, but also Fallada), and finally juxtaposing them with science fiction since the 1960s, including theoretical reflections on them with respect to ‘prediction’, such as Philip K Dick, Octavia Butler, and Margaret Atwood. We are interested in moments when historical time seems to become ‘concentrated,’ hence the axes of 1830/1930/2030.",

Speakers include prominent scholars in the field of German Studies (understood in a wide, interdisciplinary sense) and advanced graduate students, who discuss their work-in-progress based on pre-circulated papers. Besides attending the workshops, course participants meet with the instructor for two additional sessions devoted to pursuing the ties between the topics and disciplinary fields showcased by the speakers and the students' own work. The course is thus intended both as a survey of disciplinary approaches in German and Humanities Studies and as a framework that allows graduate students to hone professional skills (presenter and panel respondent, newsletter contributor, etc).",

        "title": "GOVT 1109: Disagreement",
        "description": "Disagreement is at the heart of the university and at the heart of democracies. In universities, scholars in every discipline engage in disagreement every day, from the nature of the outer reaches of the galaxy, to the value and meaning of different works of literature, to the ideal forms of government. Similarly, democracies confront disagreement as often as they do agreement: for example, how should wealth be distributed? How do we balance rights with responsibilities? How fast should speed limits be? Effective scholars and effective citizens alike need to wrestle with how to disagree. This course addresses this challenge head on. First, it will expose students to compelling points of disagreement in the academy, crossing the physical sciences, the social sciences, and the humanities. Students will observe and engage with leading academics debating questions and issues like “There is life on other planets”, “We do not need to read Shakespeare”, or “Progress is an overrated concept.” These debates will be held live on campus, giving students a chance to experience them collectively, and then engaging in a moderated discussion about them afterwards. Second, students will undertake seminar discussions about these topics, and then complete various writing assignments that engage with the questions in the debates. This will happen under the supervision of a faculty member, who can engage students in the material from their own disciplinary perspective. Third, students will complete a set of common writing assignments online that are also linked into the course content, further reinforcing both their instruction in writing and their appreciation of the importance of disagreement.",

Emphasis is on how to make meaningful comparisons between systems in different countries. Towards that goal, we will be looking at a dozen countries with different histories, political systems, and from various regions around the world. We will also use a comparative framework to use our knowledge of these (and other) countries to examine questions about democracies and democratization, electoral systems and political parties, authoritarian regimes, political mobilization and change, economic development and globalization, nationalism and identity politics, among other topics. The meta theme of this course is the comparative method as a unique way of leveraging our understanding about social and political phenomena.",

We will explore contexts ranging from modernity and the Trans-Atlantic slave trade and plantation complex in the New World to processes of decolonization and globalization in the contemporary digital age. This course offers an introduction to the study of Africa, the U.S., the Caribbean and other diasporas. This course will examine, through a range of disciplines, among them literature, history, politics, philosophy, the themes - including race/racism, the Middle Passage, sexuality, colonialism, and culture - that have dominated Africana Studies since its inception in the late-1960s. We will explore these issues in an attempt to understand how black lives have been shaped in a historical sense; and, of course, the effects of these issues in the contemporary moment. This course seeks to introduce these themes, investigate through one or more of the disciplines relevant to the question, and provide a broad understanding of the themes so as to enable the kind of intellectual reflection critical to Africana Studies.",

Our approach will be both historical and conceptual, attending to the force of each theoretical intervention in its context, while also drawing out the broader philosophical and political questions it continues to pose to us now.",

However, conservative thinkers are themselves committed to principles that are both quite varied and sometimes contradictory.  This course examines the assumptions upon which rest the libertarian, market/economic, and cultural/traditional strains of American conservatism and asks whether the tensions between them weaken or strengthen conservative thought as an alternative to mainstream liberalism.",

It is intended to give students an opportunity to explore aspects related to Chinese politics, economics, and society that they may have touched upon in other China-focused courses at Cornell, but have not been able to examine as fully, and with the degree of care, that they would like. In this regard, the substance of the course will be developed through an iterative process between the instructor and the seminar participants. We will spend the first part of the course doing a series of recent influential readings on contemporary China and developing initial research projects. The second half of the class will be organized around student led presentations of research projects (accompanied by relevant academic, media, and policy readings). (SC)",

Yet critical theory’s insights into processes of subject formation, social relations, mass culture, and general emancipatory drive continue to inform and be of value to scholars of race concerned with the everyday production and transmission of ideas about normative humanity. At the same time, in their engagement with theory's blindspots, scholars of race demonstrate the racialized histories, contexts, and assumptions that make up that for which \"theory\" cannot account, as well as that from which it has unquestioningly emerged. This course explores contemporary critical scholarship on race, as defined by its relationship to anti-positivist epistemologies, theories of the subject, critiques of traditional ontology and aesthetics, and engagement with the Black radical tradition, environmental humanities, psychoanalysis, and more. Some familiarity with key figures and ideas in postcolonial theory and Black studies is desirable though not absolutely necessary.

We then consider the circumstances in social scientific contexts which commonly lead to assumption violations, and the detection and implications of these problems. This leads to modified regression estimators that can offer limited forms of robustness in some of these cases. Finally, we briefly introduce likelihood-based techniques that incorporate assumptions about the distribution of the response variable, focusing on logistic regression for binary dependent variables. Students are expected to produce a research paper built around a quantitative analysis that is suitable for presentation at a professional conference. Some time will be spent reviewing matrix algebra, and discussing ways to implement computations using statistical software.",

The interdisciplinary course, linking political philosophy, media theory, and race studies, thinks with a wide range of scholars for whom digitality, as it encounters biopolitics, is generative for a deeper understanding of the datafied world. This exploration follows sections, including data as a resource, digital embodiment and corporeality, digital labor and necropolitics, and biopolitical resistance in digital spaces. Foundational to the course are inquiries about posthumanism and ethics, such as: How does the digital reconfigure traditional boundaries between human and non-human, self and other?

Study the major types of 'players' in the industry, especially owners, operators, and brand companies, and independents as well as the various types of business arrangements between parties.   Examine several ways to classify both hotels and hotel customers, and then review hotel brands, and loyalty programs. Take a deeper dive into the revenue performance of a hotel, and look at some key metrics, as well as competitors and relative positioning.   Prepare for and take a certification training program called 'Certificate in Hotel Industry Analytics'  II) the operations of the Rooms Division of a hotel Examine the roles of a General Manager and several Division Directors, and discuss the nature of a Hotel Executive Committee.   Look at hotel roles in terms of 'Front of the House' vs. 'Back of the House', and analyze how individual performance is evaluated.   Take a much deeper dive into the Rooms Division - we will cover several areas, but much of our focus will be the front desk and housekeeping (note that these two areas are also the focus of the Hotel Practicum, details of which are below).   Study overbooking (why and how), as well as some examples of the intersection of operations and analytics.   Examine several revenue and cost line items on a Profit & Loss (P&L) statement, as well as the drivers of those line items, and look at various scenarios of hotel performance to see how those are reflected on a P&L.

Why do we apply this concept to Christianity, Islam and Judaism and to the deep feelings we associate with secular forms of devotion and enthusiasm - for food, for love, for family, for art, for sport? In this seminar, we will discover that religion is a distinctly modern concept, developed to address the psychological and social needs of Europeans increasingly adrift from the traditional communal practices and moral commitments of their parents and grandparents. Tracing the history of religion - rather than the history of religions - from the age of Immanuel Kant to the age of Emmanuel Levinas, we will examine paradoxical connection between the rise of religion and the decline of faith.",

In 1921, a British liberal announced that democracy had already been accepted as the normal and natural form of government. World War I had delivered Europe's old monarchies and autocracies a fatal blow. Three massive continental empires had fallen apart, making way to parliamentary democracies everywhere from Germany to Poland and the Balkans. Yet by the 1930s, few of these democracies were still standing. In the east, a new political experiment had culminated in the rise of a Soviet Empire. In Germany, the democratic elections of 1933 enabled Hitler's rise to power and the growth of a regime unlike anything anyone had ever seen before. In Italy, Mussolini stamped parliamentary democracy under his foot, proclaiming the victory of totalitarianism. A variety of authoritarian regimes arose in between these extremes. They formed alliances and battled each other: at first in the Spanish Civil War and then in World War II. In this seminar, we will closely examine the rise and fall of democracies and anti-democratic regimes in Europe between the two world wars, in order to understand how democracy and authoritarianism are related and what kinds of challenges democracies have faced - both in the past and at present.",

Drawing together materials from Indian Ocean studies, Buddhist studies, and critical studies of colonialism, modernity, and nation-state formation, this course attends to the ways in which changing trans-regional conditions shape local Buddhisms, how Buddhist collectives around the Indian Ocean arena shape one another, and how trade, religion, and politics interact.

Its mineral resources travel the globe - the uranium used to bomb Japan in 1945 came from the Congo, and if you have a cellphone, you probably have a bit of the Congo in your pocket. But the region has been a key site for global trade for centuries. More than 400 years ago, diplomats from the mighty Kongo kingdom were stationed in Brazil and Europe, intervening in global affairs. Later, more than seven million enslaved people were forcibly taken from the region, a trade that brought terrible suffering, but also ensured that Congo region culture and politics would shape the Atlantic world. The Congo's first democratically elected leader, Patrice Lumumba, inspired generations of freedom fighters around the world, and his assassination at the hands of Belgian forces and their Congolese allies (with aid from Canadian soldiers and the CIA) has inspired outrage ever since - and transformed African geopolitics. The Congo was arguably the site of the first struggle for a second decolonization on the African continent, and activists have been fighting to democratize the state since the 1960s. It is famed for its novelists, philosophers, musicians, and artists. This course will explore the Congo region's global influence, and consider how diverse globalizations shaped the region.",

It is now safer to assume, as Comanche historian Paul Chaat Smith has pointed out, that everything you know about Indians is in fact wrong. Most people have much to unlearn about Native American history before true learning can take place. This course aims to achieve that end by (re)introducing students to key themes and trends in the history of North America's indigenous nations. Employing an issues-oriented approach, the course stresses the ongoing complexity of Native American societies' engagements with varieties of settler colonialism since 1492 and dedicates itself to a concerted program of myth-busting.

As a class, we will study the west from a multitude of perspectives, such as race, gender, and ethnicity, the environment, labor, politics and culture. This course is designed to increase our knowledge of the social, political and intellectual developments that have shaped our understanding of the West.",

But what makes these images “scientific”? Why aren’t they just a work of art? In this course students will examine the history of scientific images from the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries. We will investigate: When did science begin to value the use of images? What purpose were scientific images meant to serve? How have technologies of production changed over time? Students will uncover who the creators of scientific images are and examine how image-making has redirected the course of knowledge. The class is addressed to anyone interested in history, art, culture, and the sciences.",

Although often remembered for mass executions by guillotine and the rise of Napoleon, it was much more. Between 1789 and 1815, the French people experimented with virtually every form of government known to the modern world: absolutist monarchy, constitutional monarchy, representative democracy, radical left-wing republicanism, oligarchy, and right-wing autocracy. This course explores the rapidly changing political and social landscape of this extraordinary period, the evolution of political culture (the arts, theater, songs, fashion, the cult of the guillotine), and shifting attitudes towards gender, race, and slavery.",

We will examine how Confucian notions of gender and family were, far from being fixed, constantly redefined by the historical and temporal needs of East Asian contexts.

How did the exercise of power between men and women intersect with religious, literary, legal and political institutions? We will approach these questions chronologically, examining the impact of the Reformation, the English Revolution, the Enlightenment, the rise of middle class and polite culture. We will also explore them methodologically and generically, with an eye to how different kinds of evidence and sources can produce different kinds of conclusions. Historians' hypotheses will be tested by analysis of primary sources.",

This course critically examines the history of U.S.-China relations from 1949 to 2025, exploring the key diplomatic, economic, military, social, and ideological developments that have shaped bilateral ties. Beginning with early Cold War hostility (1949–1972), the Korean War (1950–1953), and the prolonged diplomatic estrangement (1953–1972), the course traces pivotal moments such as Nixon’s historic rapprochement (1972-1979), the cautious engagement of normalization (1979–1989), China’s economic rise and global integration (1990s–2008), and the evolving tensions of interdependence often described as ‘One Bed, Two Dreams’ (2008–present), shifting security dilemmas, and ongoing trade and technological competition. Special attention will be given to the contemporary landscape of strategic containment, rivalry, and the price of competition and cooperation. Through a multidisciplinary approach, students will analyze primary sources, academic literature, government reports, and firsthand accounts to assess how U.S.-China relations have evolved within a broader global context. Discussions will engage with pressing issues, including military tensions in the Indo-Pacific, economic decoupling, and the future trajectory of the bilateral relationship in an era of geopolitical uncertainty.",

In this graduate seminar, we will investigate this development in historiography by studying books published over the last thirty years in the history of science (ca. 1500 to 1900). Drawing on various approaches – global, social, food, visual, and gender history – students will explore the newest approaches in the field.

At the end of the economic boom, this decade experienced the outbreak of multiple contradictions that had accumulated in the postwar period, when a poor and rural country had rapidly turned into a modern industrial society. In these years, Italy appeared dramatically torn between tradition and modernity. This seminar will explore these transformations, focusing on the relationship between culture and help us to depict a diverse landscape beyond the dominant cliche of the years of lead.

Thus we will give necessary attention to the disability experience as it overlaps and connects with lived experiences of race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and citizenship, among others. In looking particularly at the realms of employment, education, the law, and health care, we will explore the efficacy of legal and policy initiatives that are already in place, and in doing so, strongly consider the growing need for, and value of, intersectional approaches to discrimination and oppression.",

China is aiming to dominate future product cycles, and is making major inroads in digital technology, AI, and robotics. This spectacular re-emergence as a world power has also increasingly lead to political conflict, both domestically and internationally. This course proceeds by assessing the interplay between marketization and economic transformation on the one hand, and social change and resistance as seen from the perspective of workers, on the other. While the course is specifically concerned with labor issues, we will see that the workplace is a prism that condenses and refracts much broader transformations occurring in Chinese society. (SC)",

Outsourcing, offshoring, spin-offs, and the use of temporary staffing agencies all create challenges for human resource management. Firms face issues of retaining employee knowledge and skills, coordinating HR policies across multiple subcontractors, and motivating workers on different employment contracts - who in some cases work together within a workplace or virtually. In addition, organizations face increasingly complex decisions concerning the mix of sourcing strategies to use for their own HR functions and processes. The quality and content of these decisions have implications for performance outcomes, as well as for job quality and employee careers. We will analyze these challenges and evaluate strategies to address them from a comparative and international perspective, using industry- and firm-based case studies from North America, Europe, and Asia. The course will end with a discussion of current and future trends, including crowdsourcing, managing the human cloud, and the sharing economy.

Executive compensation is a very significant investment made by all corporations and how it is designed and delivered will impact the effectiveness of the organization and drive its ability to serve all of its stakeholders including employees, communities, suppliers, and customers in addition to shareholders. We will discuss the relative role, interests, and power of such entities as Institutional Shareholders, the Board, the Executives themselves, Regulators, the Press, Advisors, and rank-and-file employees in shaping the level and design of executive compensation. We will analyze how performance is measured and rewarded and discuss how those choices will impact executive decision making. We will pay special attention to the role of ESG in setting corporate priorities as reflected in the choice of performance metrics. In this course, you will come to understand the various forms of short and long-term incentives and the process by which they are benchmarked and administered. We will examine how these practices differ between public, private, and ventured owned companies. This course will be useful for those who aspire to participate in and/or oversee such programs as well as those who will administer them as a finance, an accounting, or a human resources professional. Each student will learn how to examine and analyze both proxy and financial statements.",

Big vendors like IBM, Cisco, and Siemens seized the opportunity to port enterprise tech to the municipal sector. This project didn't get far. While there have been successes, city governments were slow to define and procure smart cities solutions. And the context changed. Consumer tech innovation raced ahead, drawing a new group of giant firms into the fray. They brought new technologies, but also more money, new business models, and more aggressive approaches to government affairs and deregulation. This shift from smart cities to urban tech is ongoing and defines the landscape for engineering cyberphysical urban systems today.

At the end of the economic boom, this decade experienced the outbreak of multiple contradictions that had accumulated in the postwar period, when a poor and rural country had rapidly turned into a modern industrial society. In these years, Italy appeared dramatically torn between tradition and modernity. This seminar will explore these transformations, focusing on the relationship between culture and help us to depict a diverse landscape beyond the dominant cliche of the years of lead.

Everyone can describe a religious idea or a religious experience even though there is no agreement about what it is that makes an idea or an experience religious. How did this state of things come about? What is it that makes religion both one thing and many things? Why do we apply this concept to Christianity, Islam and Judaism and to the deep feelings we associate with secular forms of devotion and enthusiasm - for food, for love, for family, for art, for sport? In this seminar, we will discover that religion is a distinctly modern concept, developed to address the psychological and social needs of Europeans increasingly adrift from the traditional communal practices and moral commitments of their parents and grandparents. Tracing the history of religion - rather than the history of religions - from the age of Immanuel Kant to the age of Emmanuel Levinas, we will examine paradoxical connection between the rise of religion and the decline of faith.",

Students read selections from cuneiform Akkadian tablets, Egyptian Christian Coptic spellbooks, rabbinic sources such as the Talmud, among many other works. At the same time, students will be required to critically engage recent scholarship in the history of science and medicine as a way to help frame their analyses of the ancient materials. The course interrogates how ancient civilizations transmitted and received scientific knowledge, as well as the relationship between what we today tend to call science, medicine, magic, and religion. This course is intended not only for students in the Humanities and Social Sciences, but also for those majoring in science or medicine.",

Throughout the semester students perform close readings of a wide selection of Jewish texts from the Bible, Talmud, kabbalah (mysticism), philosophy, liturgy, and modern Jewish thought. In what ways are these various traditions of Judaism interrelated and/or in tension with one another? In the face of the Jewish history's tremendous diversity, what is it that has unified Judaism and the Jewish people over the centuries? By exploring these types of questions, this course examines the appropriateness of defining Judaism as a religion, an ethnicity, a civilization, and/or a culture. Readings include introductory-level textbooks and essays, as well as a range of primary source materials in translation.",

We will also study films produced overseas, in countries that may include Israel, Egypt, France, Italy, and Germany. Our discussions will be enriched by contextual material drawn from film studies, cultural studies, Jewish studies, American studies, and other related fields.

The first part of this course traces the history, trajectory, and political agency of Judeophobia and Islamophobia in texts and other forms of culture from late antiquity through the present. The second part of the course is devoted to modernity and the present especially in Europe and the United States focusing on representational practices---how Muslims/Islam and Jews/Judaism are portrayed in various discourses including the media, film and on the internet.

Bowers, an active anti-Semitic online poster, took 11 lives. Tried in 2023, he was condemned to death for his crimes. As emphasized by Assistant U.S. Attorney Soo C. Song, Bowers was driven by his belief that Jews are a cancer upon the planet. Bowers' trial was only the most recent in a series of trials and judicial proceedings, both in the U.S. and internationally, that had antisemitism at their core in a myriad of ways. This course examines various manifestations of antisemitism in law and jurisprudence, from 19th century Europe to early 20th century America to Nazi Germany and the Stalinist U.S.S.R. to the present. Among the topics covered are blood libel trials, the Dreyfus affair in France, the Leo Frank trial in Georgia, the defamation case against Henry Ford, the Nazi Nuremberg laws, the annihilation of European Jews as the core of the crimes against humanity charge at the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, and contemporary proceedings charging a hostile anti-Semitic environment at certain U.S. colleges and universities under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.",

Charismatic leaders, fascism, colonialism, sexism, racism, capitalism, globalism, climate change, famine, migration, militarism, and collapse—all have correlates or origins in the Bronze Age that we study through a variety of textual sources, including the Amarna Letters, Ramesside papyri and cuneiform documents from Syria and Turkey.

        "description": "Several Bronze Age kingdoms situated around the Eastern Mediterranean underwent a violent collapse around 1175 BCE. Archaeological and textual evidence suggest that two major socioeconomic processes played a part: the creation of the first known international system, and climate change. In our class we explore how ancient leaders reacted (or not) to these processes and what their reactions teach us about more current events. Charismatic leaders, fascism, colonialism, sexism, racism, capitalism, globalism, climate change, famine, migration, militarism, and collapse—all have correlates or origins in the Bronze Age that we study through a variety of textual sources, including the Amarna Letters, Ramesside papyri and cuneiform documents from Syria and Turkey. We also become familiar with several archaeological sites, including the Uluburun shipwreck and Ugarit, offering unique windows onto the transformative times at the end of the Bronze Age.",

Bowers, an active anti-Semitic online poster, took 11 lives. Tried in 2023, he was condemned to death for his crimes. As emphasized by Assistant U.S. Attorney Soo C.

Bowers' trial was only the most recent in a series of trials and judicial proceedings, both in the U.S. and internationally, that had antisemitism at their core in a myriad of ways.

The course operates much like a directed reading or supervised writing - students must make arrangements directly with a faculty member. Only full-time, long-term members of the faculty may teach this course. The student's role must involve a substantial lawyering experience that implicates one or more of the Law School's learning outcomes. Work for the course should consist of the types of matters that are currently handled by the clinical program. If a student wishes to seek pro bono hours certification for their work in the course, the student and faculty member should ensure the work satisfies the relevant standard.",

Bowers, an active antisemitic online poster, took 11 lives. Tried in 2023, he was condemned to death for his crimes. As emphasized by Assistant U.S. Attorney Soo C. Song, Bowers was driven by his belief that Jews are a cancer upon the planet. Bowers' trial was only the most recent in a series of trials and judicial proceedings, both in the U.S. and internationally, that had antisemitism at their core in a myriad of ways. This course examines various manifestations of antisemitism in law and jurisprudence, from 19th century Europe to early 20th century America to Nazi Germany and the Stalinist U.S.S.R. to the present. Among the topics covered are blood libel trials, the Dreyfus affair in France, the Leo Frank trial in Georgia, the defamation case against Henry Ford, the Nazi Nuremberg laws, the annihilation of European Jews as the core of the crimes against humanity charge at the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, and contemporary proceedings charging a hostile anti-Semitic environment at certain U.S. colleges and universities under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.",

This skill also requires us to question the lenses through which we ourselves discover and assess legal information. Students will sharpen their critical perspectives and develop their skills in evaluating legal information, becoming more able to articulate the way that legal information is produced; to explain, demonstrate, and critique the growing impact of artificial intelligence on legal information and data-driven processes powering legal software and tools; to more closely evaluate and choose from available tools and resources; to identify sources that are excluded or not available; and to describe the impact of legal information structures, data, and sources on access to justice. By engaging in hands-on practice and critical reflection, students will identify challenges lawyers and others will encounter when using legal information tools that incorporate AI and generative AI and will develop strategies to tackle them to conduct responsible legal research and analysis as these tools evolve. The topics in this experiential colloquium will address three major concepts: The nature and meaning of critical legal information literacy, focusing on the US-based legal researcher; Practical applications of critical legal information literacy and access to justice issues; The impacts of technological change, data, and embedded AI on legal information and access to justice, and the specific skills the lawyer must develop when working with legal information tools with AI and generative AI components.",

        "description": "Business laws can have substantial positive and negative implications for gender equality. Discriminatory laws or the absence of legislation could threaten women's economic security or create a business environment that does not adequately support working women. On the contrary, supportive laws could promote women's career growth, ability to run businesses, and equal employment opportunities, bringing economic advantages to women and society. In addition, trade liberalization policies as a primary source of economic development can affect gender equality. This explains why gender equality lies at the heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which asserts gender equality as a fundamental human right and a necessary foundation for a sustainable world. This course examines women's rights in business and trade law as a gateway toward economic growth and development. The course introduces the basics of gender and the law. It, also, looks into the relationship between gender equality and business law, including the various legal aspects of governance and board diversity, women and ownership, gender equality and alternative dispute resolution, and the challenges and advantages facing women in business law. An examination of the relevance of integrating gender issues in trade policies and a discussion of the implications of women's economic empowerment on trade follows. Economic empowerment of women is also highlighted, including promoting women in entrepreneurship, monitoring women into management roles, and empowering women in the workplace. Also, a course on women in business and trade law cannot be completed without elaborating on the role of gender equality in promoting the SDGs. The course concludes with a timely overview of how technology could be used to promote gender equality in general and women's rights in business and trade law in particular.",

Why are boys three times more likely than girls to be diagnosed as autistic, and is there any connection between the predominantly male phenomenon of autism and other stereotypically male mental traits? Are there physical representations of sexual orientation in the brain, and how are these related to gender identity? And how are scientific studies represented and misrepresented in popular debate?",

Instructed in German, this course centers texts in German and/or about Germanophone spaces. Students will read novels, short stories, and poems; look at zines, comics, and webcomics; play through video games; and watch films. Class discussions will address topics like colonialism, climate change, escapism, dystopia/utopia, and formations of gender, sexuality, race, and nation. We will explore how narratives make use of worldbuilding, immersion, plot devices, and formal elements to unfurl these futuristic and fantastic places. Taught in German.",

Through their celebration of “art for art’s sake” and all that was considered exquisite, ironic, or obscene, the Decadent aesthetes of the late-nineteenth century sought to free the pleasures of language, beauty, spirituality, and sexual desire from their more conventional moral strictures.  We will focus on the literature of the period, including works by Edgar Allan Poe, Charles Baudelaire, J.-K. Huysmans, and especially Wilde, and we will also consider related developments in aesthetic philosophy, painting, music, theater, architecture, fashion, and design, including music by Richard Wagner, Claude Debussy, and Richard Strauss and artworks by James McNeill Whistler, Aubrey Beardsley, and Gustave Moreau.",

Are these feminist retellings purely a modern phenomenon, or do certain ancient genres (e.g., lyric and choral poetry, Greek tragedy) generate feminist potential?

Rather than assuming sex is a private matter, we will analyze the ways sexuality is constituted through media engagements, in physical and online spaces, and in the ways that mediated desire play out in broad movements of consumerism and neoliberal aspirations. We will consider sexual cultures from a transnational perspective and in historical context.

        "description": "Migrants are a heterogeneous group of people (the term migrants is used to encompass different immigrant communities). The reasons for relocating to the United States, or another country, the conditions under which they relocate, whether they are authorized to remain in a country, their cultural backgrounds, their ethnic/racial identities, their education level, their gender identity and sexual orientation, and their socio-economic status are merely a few factors that contribute to immigrants' diverse experiences. Thus, this course will introduce us to different frameworks, research, and practices that can help us understand the important role of communication in different, U.S., migration experiences. On the one hand, communication can help mitigate some of the social and structural barriers that migrants face in the United States and elsewhere. On the other hand, communication can also exacerbate or lead to educational, economic, and health inequities among migrants. We will consider both ways in which communication can function for migrant communities. Overall, migration: (1) is a diverse area of research that can incorporate intrapersonal, interpersonal, community, organizational, institutional, cultural, and policy levels of analysis; (2) is studied using a wide range of methodologies; and (3) is affected by a variety of communication channels. The readings and content of this course primarily focus on the experiences of Latina/o/x immigrant communities in the U.S.",

This is not the case for MAE 2250, which focuses on applying a process and justifying decisions which lead to a (hopefully desired) outcome. You can expect to be challenged by the types of complex and open-ended problems regularly encountered in engineering practice and provided with a methodology to begin to navigate these challenges. Many of these challenges will be qualitative in nature, with no one correct answer. Your personal experiences and the experiences of your end user can - and should! - weigh into your final solutions.Our approach will follow the product development process, spanning stages of problem research through prototyping and evaluation. You will design mechanisms and devices to fulfill specific user needs and assess and iterate on various concepts that you develop and prototype. You will learn to create your own evaluation criteria and compare designs based on those criteria. These design experiences will simulate real-world engineering practices and include project management, team organization, version tracking, and oral communication. You will learn how to use computer aided design (CAD) tools effectively through projects.There will be one main group project (the open design project, or ODP) in this course and several individual assignments to support specific content. In the open design project, you will propose a problem that you will research and then spend time ideating, prototyping, and evaluating your solutions. Your group project will focus on combining mechanical constraints and requirements with an understanding of user needs and converging on a solution. The individual projects will include CAD design, mechanism analysis, machine design, and design optimization. Each of these projects will be opportunities to apply specific skills from the course, while the group project will represent the larger design process.",

Thus the course is a mixture of algebra, geometry/topology, and a little analysis. Topics include Lie algebras (an extension of the notion of vector multiplication in three-dimensional space), the exponential mapping (a generalization of the exponential function of calculus), and representation theory (which studies different ways groups can be represented by matrices). Concrete examples will be emphasized. Background not included in the prerequisites will be developed as needed. Students will be expected to be comfortable writing proofs.

The course's academic focus on critical reading and listening, written assignments, and discussion is complemented by opportunities to engage directly with music, whether attending concerts or participating in workshops with student-led ensembles.

In a semester-long active learning project, students and faculty will collaboratively produce knowledge and disseminate it via the in-progress, open-access digital humanities platform Palestinian Pedagogy Network.

Students will enhance their business and entrepreneurship learning by putting theoretical concepts into practice in starting and growing their own companies in a team environment. We expect that students will take this opportunity to make it real - eLab is not about starting theoretical companies, or theoretically exploring potential business ideas. Rather, it is about starting real companies that have the potential to grow and provide employment and economic benefit to their founders, and to provide deep experiential learning in starting and growing a business.",

You'll discover why smart companies often misprice their products, learning to recognize and avoid common pitfalls like anchoring effects, loss aversion, and overconfidence that lead to leaving money on the table or triggering destructive price wars. You'll also explore why most incentive schemes sound good on paper but fail in practice, examining how employees' limited attention, fairness concerns, and needs for respect and purpose shape their responses to contracts, so you can design compensation and performance systems that truly motivate rather than backfire. Beyond fixing your own blind spots, you'll learn to anticipate competitors' and employees' predictable biases—and when appropriate, leverage them strategically for competitive advantage. Through interactive cases, behavioral experiments, and practical frameworks grounded in real-world evidence, you'll develop immediately applicable skills for two of management's highest-stakes decisions: how to price competitively and how to motivate your team effectively—skills essential whether you're leading a business unit or advising clients as a consultant, and that will set you apart as a leader who makes better decisions.",

This course will explore the concepts of ESG and sustainability and build the case for them as a business imperative and driver of growth. Following a series of foundation-setting sessions, we'll leverage case studies and guest speakers to learn about: (1) Innovators focused on sustainability as a value proposition and core commitment; (2) Investors seeking financial returns alongside societal impact; and (3) Incumbents working to adjust their business models to capitalize on growing interest in sustainability. The course has been designed for students pursuing careers in technology with the conviction that command of this material will lead to better outcomes on the job. We'll explore the current and potential role of entrepreneurship to address some of the greatest sustainability challenges. We'll also consider the innovative business opportunities created by sustainability-related legislation and regulation. By the end of the course, students will be able to articulate the meaning of ESG and sustainability as well as distinctions between the terms. They will be able to describe the ways in which environmental and social topics may create opportunities and risks for companies and explain how companies and investors can make sustainability a driver of growth.",

This course is designed to enhance students' skills in moral reasoning as it applies to managerial decision making. It thus examines normative concepts and principles that typically enter into moral reasoning and uses those concepts and principles in analyzing real-world cases. Discussions are designed to help students understand the moral issues confronting the decision makers in the cases and explore how those issues might be addressed in ethically responsible ways.",

And you can begin to see how you can turn situations into profitable negotiations-getting a hotel room upgrade, managing a dispute on a client team, finagling a deadline extension.The goal of this class is to help you do better in these and other important negotiations. As is true in life, there is no formula you can simply apply to achieve success in negotiation. Nor is there a single right answer to the question of what is the best tactic to use. What we will do, however, is provide you with frameworks and empirical findings that shed light on which tactics are likely to be effective, given particular situational constraints (relationships, few outside options, etc.). Your jobs are to hone your ability to decide when a tactic is likely to work, and to practice using the appropriate skills to gain experience and confidence.",

This course differs from the classes offered from the engineer side in that we will use a business-centric approach, where we first begin with the business problem to be solved, and then we cover the technical methodologies to solve the context-specific use cases. Throughout the course I will teach you a decision-making framework to unite the various disparate use cases under a common thread. This framework draws upon my years of experience as both an AI researcher and as a business consultant. I have been fortunate to apply ML to various business contexts, from Silicon Valley startups to the Fortune 500, from private equity to non-profit organizations, and I am actively using and evolving this framework in my current role as an entrepreneur in my own AI startup. I will show you how to use this framework using a mixture of business case studies, real-world context data sets, lectures, and guest speakers.

The Middle East is a loosely defined geographic area, which for the purpose of this course will include parts of North Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean, the Fertile Crescent, and the Arabian Peninsula. Concentrating on the Middle East in the 19th century will provide the context in which to discuss ideas such as imperialism, colonialism, orientalism, center-periphery relations, centralization vs. decentralization and ethnic nationalism against the background of fast-moving developments of the Late Ottoman Empire.  Students will be expected to have basic background knowledge in Middle Eastern/Islamic History.",

By surveying the wide range of forms through which political theory has been practiced-such as treatises, dialogues, plays, aphorisms, novels, manifestos, letters, speeches, illustrations, and films-we explore the ways in which political theory reflects upon, criticizes, and reshapes the basic concepts, habits of perception, and modes of feeling through which people make sense of the political world, from big events like wars and revolutions to everyday experiences of felt injustice or alienation. Our approach will be both historical and conceptual, attending to the force of each theoretical intervention in its context, while also drawing out the broader philosophical and political questions it continues to pose to us now.",

Some of these paradoxes have widely accepted answers, but many do not. Paradoxes include (but are not limited to) Zeno's paradoxes, the sorites paradox, the liar paradox, paradoxes of probability, the doomsday and simulation arguments, Newcomb's puzzle, and the trolley problem. These paradoxes will be used as a stepping stone to deeper philosophical questions. Some of the questions we'll tackle include: Is time real? What is a person? Is infinity coherent? How is science possible? What is knowledge? What is it to be rational? What should we do? Does God exist? And finally, why is death bad?",

What forms of cognitive decline or physical change could you survive (and still be you)? On the flip side, were you ever a fetus? How should the rights of pregnant women be balanced against those of the fetus? Should parents be given control over the genetic make-up of their children? Are some forms of human enhancement morally troubling? Should we aim to be better than well? What is it to be disabled?  How should scarce health care resources or costly therapies be allocated to those in need? Should organ sales be permitted? Should medical treatment (or health insurance!) ever be compulsory, or is mandating treatment unacceptably paternalistic?

Environmental concerns also highlight important economic, epistemological, legal, political, and social issues in assessing our moral obligations to nature as well as other humans. This course examines various perspectives expressed in both contemporary and historical debates over environmental ethics by exploring four central questions: What is nature?

Then the focus will turn to specific types of morally troublesome humor, including racist and sexist jokes, stereotype-exploitation more generally, mockery, jokes about disability and assault, and punching up and down.

The course format provides flexibility, but in some ways is more demanding than a course with a traditional format. Success requires discipline and well-developed study habits. Students without high school physics should allow extra time. Evaluation includes an oral lab check, a selection of graded homework problems, and a written test for each unit; these must be completed within a flexible set of deadlines. Major topics for PHYS 1102: electric and magnetic forces and fields, electric currents and circuits, electromagnetic induction, alternating current, electromagnetic waves, optics, interference and diffraction, relativity, quantum physics, and nuclear physics.

The extraordinary relationship between light and life provides an important unifying framework for understanding the luminescence of living organisms, the striking and flamboyant coloration of plants and animals as well as the inconspicuous nature of their camouflage in terms of physics, chemistry and biology. This course will enhance your understanding of the natural world through studying the relationships between light and life. This course is suitable for life sciences majors.",

Our primary point of entry into these questions will be Hollywood, from the industry's early silent films, through the period generally considered classical, down to the present day. We will also study films produced overseas, in countries that may include Israel, Egypt, France, Italy, and Germany. Our discussions will be enriched by contextual material drawn from film studies, cultural studies, Jewish studies, American studies, and other related fields. Students will be expected to view a significant number of films outside of class-an average of one per week-and engage with them through writing and in-class discussion. The directors, screenwriters, composers, and actors whose work we will study may include: Charlie Chaplin, Irving Berlin, Al Jolson, Fanny Brice, Billy Wilder, Barbra Streisand, Woody Allen, Mel Brooks, Aviva Kempner, Joan Micklin Silver, the Marx Brothers, and the Coen Brothers.",

This practicum, designed for advanced undergraduates and graduate students, will allow participants to develop the skills central to these complementary professions.  The course will include units on writing effective performance reviews, working with student playwrights on new script development, preparing informational materials for directors, designers and actors, writing program essays and other informational materials for audiences, script preparation for production, and selecting/preparing translations for production. While our focus will be on the theatre, students with interest in applying these skills to film/television/media or dance contexts are welcome. (HTC)",

Historically, that system built on social cognition has been ignorant about how human judgment actually works—producing errors as a result. This course explores the science of how we think about other people—our perceptions, memories, and judgments—can shape decisions and outcomes in the legal system, sometimes with devastating consequences. Grounded in psychological science and research on social cognition, we’ll examine how mental shortcuts, impression formation, moral judgment and group dynamics influence everything from eyewitness testimony to police investigations, from jury deliberations to sentencing. We will apply classic and cutting-edge research to identify what went wrong in real-world cases and how we could do better.

We are also motivated to maintain purity in the less metaphorical sense—most cultures have norms about keeping bodies and living spaces clean. We even have an emotion—disgust—that seems especially attuned to certain kinds of dirtiness (such as bodily fluids and rotten food).   The concept of purity, then, appears to be a deep aspect of human psychology—from the basic motivation to maintain physical purity, to the metaphors of purity and cleanliness that feature heavily in morality and religion across cultures. In this course we will look at the psychology of purity by reading widely on the topic, including historical, religious, anthropological, and psychological topics that center on purity in both the physical and moral/spiritual sense. Our aim will be to understand how this basic notion of pure/impure or clean/dirty has come to shape our psychology and our culture.",

To understand the construct of race and its consequences we will perform close reading and critical analysis of theoretical and empirical work in social psychology.

Racial inequality and structural racism are chief among such problems. Policy is thus widely understood and frequently touted as a means for redressing the harms of racism. Yet, public policy has also been identified as a channel through which racism flows. These seemingly paradoxical understandings of the relationships between racism and public policy raise critical questions about equality, democracy, the economy, and politics. This course examines such questions. questions. We begin by theoretically grounding key concepts such as race racism and public policy. We then consider the historical record, highlighting the fundamental role of racism in shaping politics and policy. Next, we build on these conceptual and historical foundations through thematic investigation of core policy elements (e.g., policy design, policy implementation, policy feedback), key policy institutions (e.g., legislatures, parties) and significant policy actors (e.g., social movement organizations, interest groups). Finally, the class wraps up with a series of policy deep dives involving close examination of specific policy domains (e.g., housing, health, the enviornment). This course provides students with the knowledge and analytical tools necessary to better understand the realities and complexities of race, racism, and public policy in the United States.",

With roots in epidemiology, public health, and demography, a key component of population health is the focus on the social determinants of health and collaborative, holistic, patient-centered and coordinated care to improve population health, identify and reduce health disparities, improve healthcare quality, and reduce healthcare costs. Given the shifting health care environment - from fee-for-service to value-based care - healthcare managers who are able to apply tools to measure, analyze, evaluate and improve population health (one aim of IHI's Triple Aim) will be well-positioned for positions in health care as the field continues to evolve.",

        "description": "Mental illnesses are common in the United States. More than 1 in 5 adults (greater than 50 million people) live with a mental health illness and 1 in 5 youth (ages 13-18) will have experienced a seriously debilitating mental illness in their lifetime. Yet, less than half of those who need treatment receive it: Depression is the leading cause of disability, suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death among youth aged 10-14, and unmet mental health needs have profound long-term consequences including reductions in overall health and quality of life; substance use and addiction; family disruption; criminal justice system involvement; homelessness; unemployment and productivity losses; and early preventable mortality. This course provides an overview of the state of mental health in the United States with a focus on the drivers of mental well-being, mental illness, and mental health inequities. We will examine how mental health practice and policy can improve (or impede) community mental well-being, quality of mental health care, and mental health outcomes for those experiencing mental illness. Intentional focus will be given to topics such as stigma, historical trauma, and racism in addition to the importance of culturally intentional and patient-centered evidence-based care in order to collectively envision healthier and more equitable futures.",

        "description": "The term firm has very broad usage. It refers to any organizational form that people use to create teams or groups that focus on achieving a specific purpose. Firms provide a structure through which people can organize themselves into those groups or teams. They are categorized by the nature of the property rights owners hold in the firm, and by the details of the firm's contractual arrangements. Common firm types include partnerships, sole proprietorships, non-profits, mutuals, and publicly traded corporations, among others. This course focuses on one important firm type: the modern publicly traded, privately owned corporation. The course uses economic and statistical analysis to study the interaction of the public corporation, the market, and the law, and how those interactions affect the welfare of managers, shareholders and consumers. The costs and benefits of that standard corporate form of organization are examined. A variety of legal institutions, some of which have evolved over decades, are analyzed. Those institutions define and govern the corporation. They include limited liability, fiduciary duties, the business judgment rule, and shareholder voting. The mechanisms of corporate governance, i.e., those legal and market-based forces that help control the corporation and ensure that managers operate it in shareholders' interest, are examined. Corporate governance mechanisms include hostile takeovers, insider trading, outside directors on the board, the monitoring role of institutional investors, audits, and executive compensation plans. State corporate law and anti-takeover devices are also discussed. The role and impact of federal policies, such as the 1933-34 Exchange Acts, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act in affecting corporate structure and managerial behavior will be an important focus. Other institutions and policies related to publicly traded corporations, such as sovereign wealth funds and government-sponsored enterprises, will also be examined along the way.",

The recent rise of ChatGPT and other generative AI applications, in particular, has accelerated the adoption of AI among individuals, institutions, industries, communities, and societies. As a technology dating back decades, AI is complex, multifaceted, and dynamic, involving different techniques, categories, philosophies, use cases, and varied value and risks. Developing and maintaining an in-depth, nuanced, and up-to-date understanding of AI, AI-related technologies including big data and digital platforms, and the best practices and lessons learned during the design, implementation, and use of these technologies in diverse regions and sectors is critical to public policy. Such knowledge enables today’s and tomorrow’s practitioners and policymakers to design roadmaps, frameworks, strategies, artifacts, services, and policies to make a positive impact on our society.

Everyone can describe a religious idea or a religious experience even though there is no agreement about what it is that makes an idea or an experience religious. How did this state of things come about? What is it that makes religion both one thing and many things? Why do we apply this concept to Christianity, Islam and Judaism and to the deep feelings we associate with secular forms of devotion and enthusiasm - for food, for love, for family, for art, for sport? In this seminar, we will discover that religion is a distinctly modern concept, developed to address the psychological and social needs of Europeans increasingly adrift from the traditional communal practices and moral commitments of their parents and grandparents. Tracing the history of religion - rather than the history of religions - from the age of Immanuel Kant to the age of Emmanuel Levinas, we will examine paradoxical connection between the rise of religion and the decline of faith.",

In doing so they helped create Buddhist communities in the places we now refer to as southern China, India, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia.  The course explores these circulatory histories by focusing on case studies in each of four historical periods: premodern (esp. early second millennium A.D.); the era of 19th-century colonial projects; mid-20th-century nation-state formation in South and Southeast Asia; and contemporary (early 21st century) times.  Drawing together materials from Indian Ocean studies, Buddhist studies, and critical studies of colonialism, modernity, and nation-state formation, this course attends to the ways in which changing trans-regional conditions shape local Buddhisms, how Buddhist collectives around the Indian Ocean arena shape one another, and how trade, religion, and politics interact.

Geographically, the course traces the transmission of scientific knowledge in ancient Babylonia, Iran, Egypt, Israel, Turkey, and beyond. As such, the course offers students a tour of different ancient civilizations and corpora. Students read selections from cuneiform Akkadian tablets, Egyptian Christian Coptic spellbooks, rabbinic sources such as the Talmud, among many other works. At the same time, students will be required to critically engage recent scholarship in the history of science and medicine as a way to help frame their analyses of the ancient materials. The course interrogates how ancient civilizations transmitted and received scientific knowledge, as well as the relationship between what we today tend to call science, medicine, magic, and religion. This course is intended not only for students in the Humanities and Social Sciences, but also for those majoring in science or medicine.",

In the face of the Jewish history's tremendous diversity, what is it that has unified Judaism and the Jewish people over the centuries? By exploring these types of questions, this course examines the appropriateness of defining Judaism as a religion, an ethnicity, a civilization, and/or a culture.

These are just a sampling of the many buzzwords associated with groups of allied practices like Yoga, Meditation, and Mindfulness that have contemplative and physical dimensions. With mythologized origins among communities of obscure holy men living in the mountains of South Asia, yoga-centered traditions are now part of a multi-billion-dollar global industry, endorsed by celebrities and everyday people alike. In fact, statistics show that at least 1 out of 6 Americans today performs some kind of regular yoga routine. Indeed, the image of the proverbial yoga practitioner has been so influential on American public life, that at least two popular cultural icons from the past century, a baseball player and a cartoon character, have borne the first name Yogi. This course examines the evolution of yogic systems across three key historical periods—the classical, colonial, and contemporary—and offers students new perspectives on how activities that originated or stemmed from religious practice have acquired new meanings and objectives. Our approach will allow us to investigate both the continuities and disruptions within yogic philosophies from ancient times to the present. It will also allow us to assess how yoga-related concepts intersect in present times with notions of spiritual liberation, health and wellness, capitalist success, and racial justice.",

The centrality and universality of religion and myth-making in social and symbolic life has been fundamental in the development of cultural theory. Our aim is to understand with this is so. We begin by examining the classic theories of religion in the works of Durkheim, Marx, Weber, Mauss, and Freud, among others, followed by an exploration of how these theories have been influential in anthropological studies of symbolism, cosmology, ritual, selfhood, myth, sorcery, witchcraft, and pilgrimage. We conclude by examining the apparent persistence, revival and transformation of religious and magical beliefs and practices within modern, modernizing, and postcolonial states. We ask whether an increasing politicization and globalization of religious ideology through technological mediation poses significant challenges to the anthropological analysis of religion. In so doing, we also try to understand better the human experience of and identification with the spiritual, mythical, and religious in the contemporary moment. This, in turn, leads us to investigate the inherent volatility of such identifications and experiences within the larger national and global framework of cultural politics.",

As unbound energies, the drives give rise to symptoms, repetitive acts, and fantasmatic stagings that menace our health and sometimes threaten social coexistence, but that also rise to the desires, creative acts, and social projects we identify as the essence of human life.

The course will begin with the labor migrations of the 1830s and continue up to the present period.

        "description": "Video games have become one of the major cultural forces of the world, far surpassing the size of the film and music industries combined. They have also been key to developments in digital culture and technology, with the full extent of their impact on contemporary society only beginning to be understood. For much of the history of digital games, the vast majority of popular works have come from Japan—Nintendo, Sony, Sega, Capcom, Namco, and other companies have defined the medium as we know it—yet this remains largely not reflected in the growing discipline of game studies. In this course, we will explore key works from throughout game history and game studies in relation to culture and media in Japan, through experiments in writing, gameplay, and other forms of critical media practice.

Going from a small and largely secretive group of mystical practitioners to a mainstream form of piety in the late medieval period, Sufism has a fascinating history, filled with intrigue, controversy, conflict and interesting characters. In this course, students will delve deep into the history of Sufism and read widely from across the Sufi and anti-Sufi traditions. Concentration will be given to practical questions of how Sufis saw themselves and their relationship to God and the world, how they built mystic community, spurned or embraced family life, interacted with mainstream society, and engaged in controversial erotic practices. Across the course, we will read Sufi histories and biographies, poetry, introductory treatises, as well as anti-Sufi polemics and stories.",

We will investigate several theories of humor (theories of what makes things funny), we then turn our attention to what the general relation between humor and morality might be: does immorality in a joke or wisecrack eliminate its funniness, dampen its funniness, have no effect on its funniness, or increase its funniness? Then the focus will turn to specific types of morally troublesome humor, including racist and sexist jokes, stereotype-exploitation more generally, mockery, jokes about disability and assault, and punching up and down. The course will conclude by investigating what makes for a good or bad sense of humor, as well as the possible absurdity of life and how that might be funny.",

Yet it’s also a way to separate self and other, or establish order by distinguishing use and waste. When is trash a helpful byproduct? What can we learn about a society from the things it rejects or discards? How might trash become a site for philosophy and art, and if it can be viewed as beautiful, should it be? This seminar explores poetic and popular “trash talk” that employs metaphors about garbage, its landscapes (landfills, wastelands), and its cognates (excess, abject, refuse, waste) to investigate what values and alternatives arise from the parts of society deemed unvaluable and the parts of life determined unviable.

Throughout we will create a dialogue between texts, both across centuries (e.g., Locke on Property with Indigenous Dispossession; Balzac’s Pere Goriot with Piketty’s Capital in the 21st Century) as well as across genres (e.g., Nomadland with Geissler’s Seasonal Associate). At stake are the narrative and figurative moments in theoretical texts as well as crucial literary sources (novels, novellas, and plays) as they collectively develop the modern economic paradigms of industry, exchange, credit-debt, and interest – as well as the people they often leave out: women, people of color, the working class.

Course materials are designed to illustrate the distinctive features of the sociological perspective and to start you thinking sociologically about yourself and the broader social world. To think sociologically is to recognize that being embedded in the world constrains behavior, and that individuals are both social actors and social products. To think sociologically is also to recognize that our contemporary world, with its enduring cultural, political, and economic institutions, is as much a social product as we are. We will begin by covering theoretical and methodological foundations of the sociological perspective.  We will go on to explore the concept of social stratification and will survey primary axes of social difference. In the second half of the course we will look more closely at how individuals relate to each other, how social inequality is enacted and reinforced in everyday life, and at the way in which the organization of social life shapes individuals and groups, such as through social networks, residential neighborhoods, schooling, families, and on-line communication.",

Racial inequality and structural racism are chief among such problems. Policy is thus widely understood and frequently touted as a means for redressing the harms of racism. Yet, public policy has also been identified as a channel through which racism flows. These seemingly paradoxical understandings of the relationships between racism and public policy raise critical questions about equality, democracy, the economy, and politics. This course examines such questions. questions. We begin by theoretically grounding key concepts such as race racism and public policy. We then consider the historical record, highlighting the fundamental role of racism in shaping politics and policy. Next, we build on these conceptual and historical foundations through thematic investigation of core policy elements (e.g., policy design, policy implementation, policy feedback), key policy institutions (e.g., legislatures, parties) and significant policy actors (e.g., social movement organizations, interest groups). Finally, the class wraps up with a series of policy deep dives involving close examination of specific policy domains (e.g., housing, health, the enviornment). This course provides students with the knowledge and analytical tools necessary to better understand the realities and complexities of race, racism, and public policy in the United States.",

While some workplaces now actively seek neurodivergent talent, others still demand rigid conformity. Mental health institutions once housed those seen as different; today, many face prison instead. Schools praise “neurodiversity” while still punishing students who can’t sit still. Through a sociological lens, we’ll examine how social background, cultural expectations, and institutional power shape who gets support versus surveillance, who gets accommodated versus excluded. From mental health and social movements to education and employment, from gender and sexuality to race and class, we’ll investigate how society is unevenly shifting from pathologizing differences to recognizing diverse ways of being human. We’ll examine who gets to define what counts as normal, who benefits from these definitions, and what happens to those who don’t fit.

The course covers intermediate topics in linear regression, and provides an introduction to models for categorical and count data, the analysis of time data, and longitudinal data. We'll also discuss data-related issues such as missing data and weighting, and data that are complicated by issues of non-random design. While statistical modeling is the focus of the course, we proceed with the assumption that models are only as good as the theoretical and substantive knowledge behind them. Thus, in covering the technical material, we will spend considerable time discussing the link between substantive knowledge and statistical practice.",

        "description": "Politicians, scientists, and citizens worldwide face many environmental issues today, but they are neither simple nor straightforward. Moreover, there are many ways to understand how we have, do, and could value the environment from animal rights and wise use to deep ecology and ecofeminism. This class acquaints students with some of the challenging moral issues that arise in the context of environmental management and policy-making, both in the past and the present. Environmental concerns also highlight important economic, epistemological, legal, political, and social issues in assessing our moral obligations to nature as well as other humans. This course examines various perspectives expressed in both contemporary and historical debates over environmental ethics by exploring four central questions: What is nature? Who counts in environmental ethics? How do we know nature? Whose nature?",

In this course we will study the twentieth century development of East Asian combat and healing traditions, and the transport of those disciplines to the U.S. We will examine the personal, community, national, and global stakes of East Asian arts for those who invest in suppressing, teaching, and practicing them. We will consider how East Asian martial and medical practices relate, for example, to global and local histories of orientalism, colonialism, migration, and racism, and to historical post-colonial, anti-racist, feminist, and LGBTQ movements. Over the course of the semester, we will research martial and medical arts as they have been practiced in Ithaca, and place these local histories into their broader historical contexts. (SC)",

What forms of cognitive decline or physical change could you survive (and still be you)? On the flip side, were you ever a fetus? How should the rights of pregnant women be balanced against those of the fetus? Should parents be given control over the genetic make-up of their children? Are some forms of human enhancement morally troubling? Should we aim to be better than well? What is it to be disabled?  How should scarce health care resources or costly therapies be allocated to those in need? Should organ sales be permitted? Should medical treatment (or health insurance!) ever be compulsory, or is mandating treatment unacceptably paternalistic?

This course encourages students to examine concepts of disease, suffering, health, and well-being in their immediate experience and beyond. In the process, students will gain a working knowledge of ecological, critical, phenomenological, and applied approaches used by medical anthropologists. We will investigate what is involved in becoming a doctor, the sociality of medicines, controversies over new medical technologies, and the politics of medical knowledge. The universality of biomedicine, or hospital medicine, will not be taken for granted, but rather we will examine the plurality generated by the various political, economic, social, and ethical demands under which biomedicine has developed in different places and at different times. In addition, biomedical healing and expertise will be viewed in relation to other kinds of healing and expertise. Our readings will address medicine in North America as well as other parts of the world. In class, our discussions will return regularly to consider the broad diversity of kinds of medicine throughout the world, as well as the specific historical and local contexts of biomedicine.",

Freud finds that these apparently irrational acts and behavior are ordered by the logic of the fantasy, which provides a mental representation of a traumatic childhood experience and the effects it unleashes in the mind and body-effects he called drives.  As unbound energies, the drives give rise to symptoms, repetitive acts, and fantasmatic stagings that menace our health and sometimes threaten social coexistence, but that also rise to the desires, creative acts, and social projects we identify as the essence of human life.  Readings will include fundamental texts on the unconscious, repression, fantasy, and the death drive, as well as case studies and speculative essays on mythology, art, religion, and group psychology.  Students will be asked to keep a dream journal and to work on their unconscious formations, and will have the chance to produce creative projects as well as analytic essays.",

        "description": "Topic - Biological Art (Bio Art): From the late 20th-century to the present, artists have made art using live entities including plants, animals, cells, tissue cultures and bacteria. They have designed habitats, crops, body organs, created new species and attempted to salvage extinct ones. Some artists also have produced works in traditional media such as painting, sculpture and photography. While artists always have imaged and sometimes directly engaged with aspects of the natural world in their art, bio art responds to recent developments in genetics and information technologies. Because of its foundation on the life sciences this art entails significant ethical and political dimensions. In this seminar students will explore multiple areas of bio art with attention to pertinent artistic and critical literature and to the scientific practices in which the works are based. For this purpose the class will consult with specialists and visit laboratories on campus relevant to the art covered in the course. We expect these interdisciplinary investigations to prepare students for a grounded assessment of bio art.",

Following these preliminaries, students proceed to guided readings in Tibetan literature designed to introduce them to the formal approach of Tibetan lexical semantics with an emphasis on the role of verbs in determining argument realization options. Over the duration of the course, students encounter new vocabulary (and associated Buddhist concept hierarchies) and increasingly complex sentence structures. This course thus provides a solid foundation for the later exploration of other genres of literature and styles of composition.",

Beginning with the cybernetically and systems-inspired work of the late sixties, we will explore early uses of computer technology, including early experiments in synthetic video in the 1970s. An overview of pre-internet telematic experiments will lead to an investigation of net art and later currents of digital art. The ongoing development of behavioral art forms will be a central theme. Critical evaluation of various attitudes concerning technology will be encouraged.",

Writer/creators are visual and physical explorers, choreographers of language text and imagery, artistic inventors. Work we explore this year includes the inspiration of Carrie Mae Weems, Kara Walker, R A Walden, William Kentridge, Coco Fusco, Toni Morrison Jenny Holzer, Beatriz Cortez, Laurie Anderson, the exploration of generative AI interventions and immersive performance techniques.

While puppies and kittens and healthy adult dogs and cats are still euthanized in some shelters, euthanasia rates have dropped remarkably in the last decade. However, many animals are still bred and sold in the US in less than ideal conditions. The large population of free-roaming and feral cats is both a cause and effect of feline overpopulation; approaches to cat control are controversial and emotionally charged. Animal cruelty, abuse and neglect, including animal fighting and hoarding, represent issues with which veterinarians are becoming increasingly engaged in their communities. The number of well-intentioned pet owners seeking exotic companion animals as pets is increasing. As our community expands globally, welfare issues from abroad are also becoming more apparent. Other controversial issues that impact companion animal welfare include: non-therapeutic/elective surgeries, access to veterinary care, and quality of life measures with advancing technologies in veterinary medicine. The goal of the course is to provide the tools needed for veterinary students to assess the welfare of the companion animals they treat; and to provide information that enables them to begin developing their positions on some of the common companion animal welfare issues, allowing them to assume leadership roles with regards to such issues in their future communities.",
